  # Express Notes
  ## Description
  This is a note taking app built on Node.js using Express as the server framework. The API handles GET, POST and DELETE requests based on the front-end user interactions. The user can create and delete notes and the data is persistent on the server. I deployed the application on Heroku (link below).
